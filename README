Scenarios:

1. both services in a single process:

spring.application.name=monolith
projects.enabled=true
allocations.enabled=true

- create a project
- create an allocation
- verify that creation of allocation all happens internally to the process, and that the ProjectService bean was wired into the allocations service


2. two instances of application, each configured uniquely:

A:
application configured one way:
spring.application.name=allocations
allocations.enabled=true
projects.enabled=false

B:
second instance configured like this:
spring.application.name=projects
allocations.enabled=false
projects.enabled=false

start eureka
start B, make sure it registers with eureka under the right name
create a project
start A, make sure it registers with eureka under the right name
create an allocation
verify that allocation service is autowired with a feign projectclient
