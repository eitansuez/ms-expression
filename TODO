some tests worth running
- verify actuator/beans endpoint to ensure that beans for disabled services are not created
- verify actuator/mappings endpoint to ensure endpoint for colocated services are namespaced and standalone services are at the root url

- start building some automated tests!

- find a way to generalize how this is configured
- in this context it's easier not to use annotations and to configure the beans in one place.
  i know spring has an alternative syntax now for configuring a web app, its routes, etc..
  worth looking into

- tuck everything in as a dependency and configure it all using spring boot autoconfiguration

instead of conditionalonexpression, just use @Profile
eliminate services.active
and instead use spring.profiles.active to tell you which services you have in play
